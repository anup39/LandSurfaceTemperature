# LandSurfaceTemperature

The script is for getting the land surface temperature from Landsat satellite series in any interval of date. All the algorithms and mathematical intutions is taken from this paper https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/9/1471/htm . The paper have provided the code in Javascript and the images will be downloaded in google drive. I have converted all the Javascript code into python and automate the download process so that you can download as many images in your local computer.
